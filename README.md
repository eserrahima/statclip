App for statistical Data Analysis learning

The application is developed in R language and uses the shiny package for the user interface. Although the application obviously
allows the analysis of real data through graphs and statistical methods, its main objective is facilitating the acquisition of
statistical concepts. To accomplish this, menus, configuration options and results are presented in a way that fosters
reflection on basic statistical ideas.

The app is intended to have the following characteristics: free, easy to use, multi-platform, scalable and with a focus 
on statistical concepts and ideas.
